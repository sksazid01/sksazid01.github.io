# Portfolio Redundancy Cleanup Summary

## Overview
Performed comprehensive scan of portfolio to identify and remove redundant code, duplicate content, and unused components.

## Issues Found & Fixed

### 1. ❌ Deleted: Unused Component File
**File:** `src/components/HackathonAchievement.tsx`

**Reason:** 
- This component was created during initial development but never imported or used in the application
- It was superseded by `ProfessionalAchievements.tsx` which provides better structure and more comprehensive achievement display
- File size: ~500+ lines of unused code

**Impact:** Cleaner codebase, reduced bundle size

---

### 2. ✂️ Removed: Duplicate Achievement Entry
**Location:** `src/components/AchievementsSection.tsx`

**Removed Entry:**
```tsx
{
  id: '0',
  title: '4th Position at Inter-University National Hackathon 2025',
  description: 'Team SUST_Prompt_Storm secured 4th position...',
  category: 'recognition',
  // ... full entry
}
```

**Reason:**
- This achievement was duplicated in two places:
  1. `ProfessionalAchievements.tsx` - Detailed showcase with images, team info (KEPT)
  2. `AchievementsSection.tsx` - Simple card format (REMOVED)
- The ProfessionalAchievements version is more comprehensive and professional
- It appears in a dedicated "Achievement" navigation section

**Impact:** 
- Eliminated content duplication
- Stats counter automatically updated (now shows correct totals)
- No loss of information (comprehensive version retained)
